## SEP Summary

This SEP defines the standard way for anchors and wallets to interact on behalf
of users. This improves user experience by allowing wallets and other clients
to interact with anchors directly without the user needing to leave the wallet
to go to the anchor's site. It is based on [SEP-0006](sep-0006.md), but only
supports the interactive flow, and cleans up or removes confusing artifacts. If
you are updating from SEP-0006 see the
[changes from SEP-6](#changes-from-SEP-6) at the bottom of this document.
