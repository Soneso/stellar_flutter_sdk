# SEP-0002 (Federation protocol) Compatibility Matrix

**Generated:** 2026-01-07 12:04:48  
**SDK Version:** 2.2.1  
**SEP Version:** 1.1.0  
**SEP Status:** Final  
**SEP URL:** https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0002.md

## SEP Summary

The Stellar federation protocol maps Stellar addresses to more information
about a given user. It’s a way for Stellar client software to resolve
email-like addresses such as `name*yourdomain.com` into account IDs like:
`GCCVPYFOHY7ZB7557JKENAX62LUAPLMGIWNZJAFV2MITK6T32V37KEJU`. Stellar addresses
provide an easy way for users to share payment details by using a syntax that
interoperates across different domains and providers.
