# SEP-0006 (Deposit and Withdrawal API) Compatibility Matrix

**Generated:** 2025-10-10 15:07:09

**SEP Version:** N/A
**SEP Status:** Active (Interactive components are deprecated in favor of SEP-24)
**SEP URL:** https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0006.md

## SEP Summary

This SEP defines the standard way for anchors and wallets to interact on behalf
of users. This improves user experience by allowing wallets and other clients
to interact with anchors directly without the user needing to leave the wallet
to go to the anchor's site.

Please note that this SEP provides a normalized interface specification that
allows wallets and other services to interact with anchors _programmatically_.
[SEP-24](sep-0024.md) was created to support use cases where the anchor may
want to interact with users _interactively_ using a popup opened within the
wallet application.
