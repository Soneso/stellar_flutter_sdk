# [Stellar SDK for Flutter](https://github.com/Soneso/stellar_flutter_sdk)

The [Soneso open source Stellar SDK for Flutter](https://github.com/Soneso/stellar_flutter_sdk) is build with Dart and provides APIs to build and sign transactions, connect and query [Horizon](https://github.com/stellar/horizon). To learn about the general concepts of Stellar you can read the [Stellar Development Guides](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/).


## SDK usage examples

| Example | Description | Documentation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
